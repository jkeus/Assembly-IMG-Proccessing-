# Assembly-IMG-Proccessing-
Using MIPS with MARS, this program can take a image and apply different effects on it
In order to run this code you should
  -Have MIPS and MARS Installed
  -Have all files in the repo plus MIPS/MARS all in a singular file
After running the code it should work
Im having some issues getting it to apply but I will update the instrucitons when I can get it to work on another device
